# slack-mud
A MUD client implemented for Slack


Features to implement eventually:
- OAuth Slackintegration
- Direct messaging of character setup and tutorial
- Turn based actions and movement within the party
    - will require someone to be in command of party movement
    - maybe an asynchronous voting system for party actions?
- A way to talk to the channel without the MUD thinking it's a command
- Combat
- The ability to add rooms, monsters, loot etc. to the MUD via chatting with the @slackmud bot (ADMIN only)
