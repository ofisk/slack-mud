            Born to fight, dragonborn are a bipedal reptilian race of wandering mercenaries, soldiers, 
            and adventurers. Long ago, their empire contended for worldwide dominion, but now only a

            A proud and stern race, made sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They are physically 
            stronger than humans, and have great endurance, especially in the ability to resist great heat, 
            cold, and especially damage and fatigue. However, their short stature brings about many challenges
            and they often lack the versatility of other races.

            Skillful, agile, and often times appearing arrogant, elves are somewhat fragile when compared to 
            other races.  They tend to be slim and with fair complexion which is odd given how much time they
            spend outdoors. However, their fragility is not without compensation, as their sight, reflexes,
            and quickness are nearly unrivaled amongst the other races.

            Like dwarves, gnomes are as stubborn as the packed earth they call home. When faced with danger,
            they do not hesitate to confront the threat. On the other hand, they are a timid people who like 
            to keep to themselves and have absolutely no patience for trouble makers that would disturb their 
            calm, routine way of life, employing harsh methods for dealing with them such as burying them up 
            to their chin in tightly packed dirt and leaving them there without food for a day.

            Half elves are human-elf hybrids and, as such, are the physical and mental compromise between the
            two races; in between elves and humans in terms of agility and quickness as well as constitution

            Half orcs are human-orc hybrids.  True to their partial orc heritage, they are a physically dominant
            race.  Usually standing a foot taller than the tallest human (if not more) and weighing nearly twice

            Not touched by magic as strongly as other races, but strong, resilient and ambitious nonetheless.

            Your people are the descendants of the mixture of ancient elven and demon bloodlines.  The resulting
            beings are horned humanoids that immediately reveal their demonic heritage.  They have heightened
            senses and are extremely cunning, though that sometimes leaves them untrusted by other races.  While
            excelling in magical arts, they lack deeply in most physical forms of combat.
